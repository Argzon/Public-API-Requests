# Random User Generator

This is a random user generator from https://randomuser.me/ where we basically get 12 random US users and display randomly in the page. The users have more information which are visible if you click on any card, a modal window will appear with more information. You can move forward to the next user with **Next** button or backwards with the **Prev** button. You may also filter or search users that were generated using the search function. The search function is case insensitive and it the results will appear in real time.
